Absurd kills Winter
This place is
  a storage with some additional functionalities, with the most wholepointing one:
    VERSION  CONTROL, that allows spread out teams to develop stuff in collaboration, without modifying the core version. The latter is developed by including (or not) the solutions/code from branches. So far so good.

in adition it can be used as a hosting service, supporting and displaying HTML, CSS for sure. But: 
    What about JS scripts? Can it do that?
    Using resources from CDN (but why wouldn't it?)
    API integration (yes, I used it once, changed Google font in a template)
    
And everything else is yet to be discovered, including:
  can it be used as a sort of online IDE? That would be awesome.
  would it support JS/Python code development?
  is there a playground for enthusiastic retards?
  
This list will get new positions soon enough.

a question is: can one ask questions THIS embarassing?
a question is: who cares?
